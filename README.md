My first HTML project.
While going through this course my first objective is to improve and what a better way to improve than getting out of your zone of comfort and training,

With this Recipe project i’m going to put in practice the following skills i learned in this HTML INTRODUCTION : 1/ paragraphs 
                                    2/ headers
                                    3/ links and images
                                    4/ Git and Github manipulation(wich is the hard part)
